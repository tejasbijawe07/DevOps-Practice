## Jobs, Steps, Env Vars & Conditionals

- How to control the flow of pipeline: 
- multi-job workflows, passing data between jobs, environment variables, and running steps only when certain conditions are met.



### Task 1: Multi-Job Workflow
- Create .github/workflows/multi-job.yml with 3 jobs:
- build — prints "Building the app"
- test — prints "Running tests"
- deploy — prints "Deploying"
- Make test run only after build succeeds. Make deploy run only after test succeeds.
- Verify: Check the workflow graph in the Actions tab — does it show the dependency chain?
